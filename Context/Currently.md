# Application Technical Context - Current State

## Project Overview
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Primary Components**: 
  - Landing Page with Scroll Navigation
  - Home Page (`Home.tsx`)
  - Messages Page (`Messages.tsx`)
  - Sidebar Component (`sidebar.tsx`)
  - Main Application Structure (`App.tsx`)

## Current Technical Highlights
- Modular component-based architecture
- TypeScript for type safety
- Scroll-based landing page navigation
- Custom scroll navigation hook (`useScrollNavigation`)
- Geometric hero section with animated elements
- Multiple page/component structure
- UI components located in `src/components/ui/`
- Pages located in `src/pages/`

## Active Development Focus
- Landing page scroll navigation implementation
- Scroll navigation user experience
- Component interaction and state management
- Responsive design for landing page sections

## Landing Page Navigation Strategy
- Implemented smooth vertical scrolling
- 4 distinct screen sections:
  1. Hero Section (Geometric Design)
  2. Communication Advantages
  3. Platform Features
  4. Legal Information
- Navigation buttons for section traversal
- Progress indicator for current section
- Accessibility-focused design

## New Toolbar Implementation
- New toolbar design with a sticky bottom bar
- Bottom bar contains quick action buttons
- Quick action buttons include:
  - Create new message
  - View notifications
  - Open sidebar
- New toolbar also includes a floating action button
- Floating action button triggers a modal for creating new content

## Toolbar Implementation
- Glass-effect toolbar with half-transparent background
- Fixed positioning at the top of the page
- Responsive design with backdrop blur
- Navigation links:
  - DigiCard logo on the left
  - Teams link
  - Pricing link
  - Get Started button for authentication
- Animated entrance with Framer Motion
- Consistent dark theme aesthetic
- Hover effects for interactive elements

## Potential Areas of Improvement
- Code modularity
- Component reusability
- Performance optimization of scroll animations
- Consistent styling and design patterns
- Enhance cross-browser scroll behavior

## Technical Debt Notes
- Review component sizes
- Ensure clean, focused component responsibilities
- Validate type definitions
- Add comprehensive comments
- Test scroll navigation across different devices

## Next Steps
- Implement comprehensive scroll navigation tests
- Add parallax scrolling effects
- Create more interactive section transitions
- Optimize scroll performance
- Conduct thorough code review
- Add additional test coverage
