# Application Technical Context - Current State

## Project Overview
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Primary Components**: 
  - Home Page (`Home.tsx`)
  - Messages Page (`Messages.tsx`)
  - Sidebar Component (`sidebar.tsx`)
  - Main Application Structure (`App.tsx`)

## Current Technical Highlights
- Modular component-based architecture
- TypeScript for type safety
- Multiple page/component structure
- UI components located in `src/components/ui/`
- Pages located in `src/pages/`

## Active Development Focus
- Sidebar functionality (currently editing `sidebar.tsx`)
- User interface refinement
- Component interaction and state management

## Potential Areas of Improvement
- Code modularity
- Component reusability
- Performance optimization
- Consistent styling and design patterns

## Technical Debt Notes
- Review component sizes
- Ensure clean, focused component responsibilities
- Validate type definitions
- Add comprehensive comments

## Next Steps
- Conduct thorough code review
- Implement additional test coverage
- Refactor complex components
- Optimize rendering performance
