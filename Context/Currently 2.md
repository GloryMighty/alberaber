# Current Technical Overview

## Project Structure
- Frontend Framework: React with TypeScript
- State Management: Not explicitly defined yet
- Routing: React Router (implied by multiple page components)

## Existing Pages and Components
1. **Home Page** (`src/pages/Home.tsx`)
   - Contains QuickActionCard component
   - Likely the main landing and entry point of the application

2. **Landing Page** (`src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`)
   - New page showcasing application features
   - Uses Framer Motion for animations
   - Incorporates NeonMaze component
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

3. **Network Page** (`src/pages/Network.tsx`)
   - Purpose not yet fully defined
   - Potential for social or networking features

4. **Layout Component** (`src/components/Layout.tsx`)
   - Provides overall page structure and potentially shared UI elements

5. **UI Components**
   - `NeonMaze.tsx`: Unique UI component, possibly for visual effects or navigation

## Hooks
- `useMousePosition.ts`: Custom hook for tracking mouse position
   - Suggests interactive or dynamic UI elements

## Routing Pathways
- `/`: Home page
- `/network`: Network page
- Potential for more routes to be added

## Technical Stack Observations
- React with TypeScript
- Modular component-based architecture
- Custom hooks for enhanced functionality
- Emphasis on interactive UI design

## Next Steps
- Implement landing page
- Define clear state management strategy
- Expand routing and page functionality
